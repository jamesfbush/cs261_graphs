# graphs
Python-based implementation of directed and undirected graphs for Data Structures CS261 (SP '21) at Oregon State University. 

## Directed Graphs - d_graph.py
Supports creation of a directed graph supporting these functions: 
### add_vertex
### add_edge
### remove_edge
### get_vertices
### get_edges
### is_valid_path
### dfs (depth first search)
### bfs (breadth first search)
### has_cycle
### dijkstra (Dijkstra's Algorithm) 

## Undirected Graphs - ud_graph.py
Supports creation of a directed graph supporting these functions: 
### add_vertex
### add_edge
### remove_edge
### remove_vertex
### get_vertices
### is_valid_path
### dfs
### bfs
### count_connected_components
### has_cycle
